## Implementation details
All of the 4 assignment questions have been done using the c++ language. The entire project was coded and tested on Ubuntu and Mac OS systems. 

## Run instructions

The individual c++ programs can be executed in 2 ways:

1. Navigate to each directory and follow the instructions inside each README file
2. Run the following command from the project root directory: 
```
bash execute.sh <question_number>
```
   * question_number takes the values `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, each of which correspond to the question number in the assignment PDF.
   * Input `2` for IPC is currently not supported, please find running instructions for question 2 inside its folder - `2_ipc.`
   * Input `4` takes a second optional argument - `print_pids` which can be used to print the process IDs of the different worker threads in the multithreaded program.
